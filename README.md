# Project 4: Interactive Graphics on the Web - by Aditi and Aahel

## Project Statement
This interactive experience aims to educate people about other cultures. And to also make them realise how we are fundamentally similar even with our differences. The main page of the website will introduce the experience to the users. From there the user will go on a journey through three interactive experiences:

**User form**
- The user is first asked to enter information about them - What is your name? And Where are from? From there the userâ€™s journey begins.

**Educational Section**
- This section will educate the user about other cultures. We will have 10 social education trivia generate per week.

**Pictionary**
- Pictionary will be the main interactive experience.
