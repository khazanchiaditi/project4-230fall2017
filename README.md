# Project 4: Interactive Graphics on the Web - by Aditi and Aahel

## Project Statement
This interactive experience aims to educate people about other cultures. And to also make them realise how we are fundamentally similar even with our differences. The main page of the website will introduce the experience to the users. From there the user will go on a journey through three interactive experiences:

*Since this is a cohesive step by step interactive experience, the main landing page will not have a description/link of each interactive section. When the user scrolls to a new section, he will get a title and description of that section. The breakdown of responsibilities can be found in the documentation page.

**User form**
- The user is first asked to enter information about them - What is your name? And Where are from? From there the userâ€™s journey begins.

**Educational Section**
- This section will educate the user about other cultures based on some categories. The user can choose a category they want to learn more about.

*This section will not be functional on a mobile browser.

**Pictionary**
- Pictionary will be the main interactive experience where users would be asked to draw out things and their drawings would populate over time allowing other users to see how they visually interpret things and help socially and culturally educate users in a fun and engaging way using a classic game. 

**Download Image**
- After creating an image in the last section, Users will get a confirmation message along with an option to download what they created.
