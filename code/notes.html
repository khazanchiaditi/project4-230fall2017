        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <section>
            <p class="body-copy">Creating an interactive experience to educate people about other cultures. The main page of the website introduces the experience to the users. From there the user will go on a scroll based journey through three interactive experiences:</p><br> 
            <p class="body-copy">We wanted to create a seamless and engaging experience for the user. The design was playful and involved some complex animation and implementation.</p>

       <h2>Above & Beyond</h2>
       <section>
        <h3>Concept</h3><br>
        <p class="body-copy">We wanted to create a connected and valuable experience. We brainstormed heavily when coming up with a concept which could both engage and educate young people. We strived to create a seamless experience and a journey like feeling. </p><br>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Design</h3><br>
        <p class="body-copy">Inspired by flat design, we came up with our design style. We wanted to use bright colors and bold iconography to enhance the visual aspect of the project. This also helped create a friendly and welcoming website experience. The scroll interaction was very important and crucial for the project as we wanted the user to feel like they were on a journey moving through the site. </p><br>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Code</h3><br>
        <p class="body-copy">A lot was learned while coding this interactive experience such as<br><br>
        01. Using an external library like Fullpage.js<br>
        02. Creating complex JS & CSS animations<br>
        03. Making user generated image downloadable<br>
        04. A stronger understanding of absolute and relative positioning<br>
        05. Creating custom stylised html forms<br>
